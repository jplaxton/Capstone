## Week 1 Quiz

The following code answers the questions for the week 1 quiz.

mb<-kb/1024
mb
close(con)

twitter <- readLines(con <- file("./final/en_US/en_US.twitter.txt"), encoding = "UTF-8", skipNul = TRUE)
length(twitter)

## Create a Corpus

Create a Corpus from the provided .txt files...

Translating unstructured content from a corpus of information into a meaningful knowledge base is the task of NLP.  It is important to determine what information to keep and how to look for patterns in the structure of that information to distill meaning and context.

```{r create_corpus, cache=TRUE}
# without the encoding="UTF-8" the output (textin) is polluted with â characters
textin <- readtext("./final/en_US/*.txt", encoding = "UTF-8", cache = FALSE)
my_corpus <- corpus(textin)
metadoc(my_corpus, "language") <- "english"
summary(my_corpus, showmeta = TRUE)
```

## Exploratory Analysis

The first step in building a predictive model for text is understanding the distribution and relationship between the words, tokens, and phrases in the text. The goal of this task is to understand the basic relationships you observe in the data and prepare to build your first linguistic models.

> We thus define the tidy text format as being a table with one-token-per-row. A token is a meaningful unit of text, such as a word, that we are interested in using for analysis, and tokenization is the process of splitting text into tokens. This one-token-per-row structure is in contrast to the ways text is often stored in current analyses, perhaps as strings or in a document-term matrix. For tidy text mining, the token that is stored in each row is most often a single word, but can also be an n-gram, sentence, or paragraph. In the tidytext package, we provide functionality to tokenize by commonly used units of text like these and convert to a one-term-per-row format. [@TextMining_R]

A token is a meaningful unit of text, most often a word, that we are interested in using for further analysis, and tokenization is the process of splitting text into tokens.

###Tasks to accomplish

1. **Exploratory analysis** - perform a thorough exploratory analysis of the data, understanding the distribution of words and relationship between the words in the corpora.

2. **Understand frequencies of words and word pairs** - build figures and tables to understand variation in the frequencies of words and word pairs in the data.

###Questions to consider

1. Some words are more frequent than others - what are the distributions of word frequencies?
```{r tokenize}
dataTokens <- tokens(my_corpus, what='word', remove_numbers = TRUE, 
                     remove_punct = TRUE, remove_symbols = TRUE, remove_separators = TRUE)

# make a dfm, removing stopwords and applying stemming
myStemMat <- dfm(my_corpus, remove = stopwords("english"), stem = TRUE, 
                 remove_punct = TRUE, remove_symbols = TRUE, remove_separators = TRUE)
myStemMat_td <- tidy(myStemMat)
topfeatures(myStemMat, 20)  # 20 top words
mysterytext <-set.seed(123)
textplot_wordcloud(myStemMat, min_count = 6, random_order = FALSE,
                   rotation = .25, 
                   color = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(8,"Dark2"))
```

```{r tidytext_method, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(janeaustenr)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)

original_books <- austen_books() %>%
  group_by(book) %>%
  mutate(linenumber = row_number(),
         chapter = cumsum(str_detect(text, regex("^chapter [\\divxlc]",
                                                 ignore_case = TRUE)))) %>%
  ungroup()

original_books
library(tidytext)
tidy_books <- original_books %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)

tidy_booksdata(stop_words)

tidy_books <- tidy_books %>%
  anti_join(stop_words)
tidy_books %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)

tidy_books %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(n > 600) %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, n)) +
  geom_col() +
  xlab(NULL) +
  coord_flip()
```

2. What are the frequencies of 2-grams and 3-grams in the dataset?

```{r ngram_freq}
```
3. How many unique words do you need in a frequency sorted dictionary to cover 50% of all word instances in the language? 90%?
```{r uniquewords}
```
4. How do you evaluate how many of the words come from foreign languages?

5. Can you think of a way to increase the coverage -- identifying words that may not be in the corpora or using a smaller number of words in the dictionary to cover the same number of phrases?

##Visualizing a network of bigrams with ggraph

```{r network_viz, eval=FALSE}
library(igraph)

# original counts
bigram_counts
bigram_graph <- bigram_counts %>%
  filter(n > 20) %>%
  graph_from_data_frame()

bigram_graph
set.seed(2016)

a <- grid::arrow(type = "closed", length = unit(.15, "inches"))

ggraph(bigram_graph, layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(edge_alpha = n), show.legend = FALSE,
                 arrow = a, end_cap = circle(.07, 'inches')) +
  geom_node_point(color = "lightblue", size = 5) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), vjust = 1, hjust = 1) +
  theme_void()
```
>Note that this is a visualization of a Markov chain, a common model in text processing. In a Markov chain, each choice of word depends only on the previous word. In this case, a random generator following this model might spit out “dear”, then “sir”, then “william/walter/thomas/thomas’s”, by following each word to the most common words that follow it. To make the visualization interpretable, we chose to show only the most common word to word connections, but one could imagine an enormous graph representing all connections that occur in the text.[@TextMining_R]

One of the most common structures that text mining packages work with is the document-term matrix (or DTM). This is a matrix where:

+ each row represents one document (such as a book or article),
+ each column represents one term, and
+ each value (typically) contains the number of appearances of that term in that document.

Since most pairings of document and term do not occur (they have the value zero), DTMs are usually implemented as sparse matrices.
